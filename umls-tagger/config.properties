[SEMANTIC_TYPES]
#This describes the mapping between the UMLS classification of terms and the Labels that the user want to obtain.
#Each line is a mapping; separated by |.
#The first element is the UMLS semantic type, the second is only a description of the semantic type from umls; and the 
#third one is the LABEL that we are going to obtain if a term is reached.
