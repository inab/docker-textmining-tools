<Node id="2769"/>INTRODUCTION<Node id="2781"/> <Node id="2782"/>The objectives of this study were to investigate the potential toxicity of SAR377142 during daily oral gavage to the rat for a minimum of 3 or 10 days. In addition, the toxicokinetic characteristics of SAR377142 were also determined.<Node id="3015"/> <Node id="3016"/>The dose levels were 0, 50 and 200 mg/kg/day. The doses were selected based on the results of a previous exploratory 2-week oral toxicity study performed in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats at 50, 200 and 600 mg/kg/day (DDO 0979, sanofi-aventis). In the latter study, all rats dosed at 600 mg/kg/day were found dead or euthanized prematurely on Day 5 following body weight loss and other clinical signs of hypomotility, ataxia, dyspnea, polyuria, skin redness and/or ptyalism. The dose of 200 mg/kg/day led to the premature demise of 3/12 rats (2 males and 1 female) on Day 14 or 15 and was associated with body weight loss and late onset clinical signs. The dose of 50 mg/kg/day was clinically well tolerated over 2 weeks, with only slight reductions in body weight gain and no compound-related clinical signs. In order to attain the study objectives (mainly induction of renal toxicity) without compromising animal health status and survival, the dosing duration was reduced from 15 to 10 days and the doses selected are 50 and 200 mg/kg/day.<Node id="4063"/> <Node id="4064"/>The Sprague Dawley rat is an accepted rodent species for use in toxicity studies and the oral route was selected since this is the intended route of administration in humans. The study was completed on the date appearing on the compliance statement page.<Node id="4318"/>

This was due to the reduced body weight gain when compared to the concurrent control group. The reduction in bodyweight gain was dosage related in degree, and due to the magnitude (i.e.>10% for animals given 200 mg/kg/day) was considered to be adverse.<Node id="18707"/> <Node id="18708"/>The male animals treated with 50 mg/kg/day also had a slight reduction in body weight gain and body weight throughout 10 days treatment period when compared to the concurrent control. However, the reduction was less than that seen at 200 mg/kg/day and is considered to be non adverse. There were no treatment related effect on body weight gain for female at 50 mg/kg/day as group mean values were comparable to the concurrent control. Coincident with commencement of dosing a treatment related reduction in food consumption was observed for animals from all treated Groups. The reduction in average food consumption (Day 1 to 10) was dosage related in degree and correlated to some extent to the reduced bodyweight, with greater reduction seen for those animals receiving 200 mg/kg/day (male -16.2%, female -14.1%). At 50 mg/kg/day (male -3.4%, female +0.1%) this finding was also apparent although to a lesser degree when compared to concurrent control group. <Node id="19669"/>(Table 5 and Appendix 15)<Node id="19694"/> On Day 4, there was a minimal to mild increase in prothrombin time (PT) in females and males given 200 mg/kg/day. On Day 11, there was a mild increase in neutrophil (NEUT) in males at 200 mg/kg/day, (mainly due to Animal No. 3014 which also had an increase in FIB, but no direct correlation in pathology). There were minimal increases in red blood cell (RBC), haemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Ht) of males given 200 mg/kg/day and females given ≥50 mg/kg/day, these changes correlated with the clinical finding of dehydration. There were minimal to mild dose-related increases in PT in males given 200 mg/kg/day and females given ≥50 mg/kg/day. <Node id="20339"/>(Table 6 and Appendix 16)<Node id="20364"/> On Day 4, there was no treatment-related change noted in serum chemistry parameters.<Node id="20449"/>

Consequently, the no-adverse-effect-level was considered to be 50 mg/kg/day in this study.

<Node id="73279"/>GENERAL SUMMARY Purpose<Node id="73302"/> <Node id="73303"/>The objectives of this study are to investigate the potential toxicity of SAR377142 during daily oral gavage to the rat for a minimum of 3 or 10 days. In addition, the toxicokinetic characteristics of SAR377142 will be determined. <Node id="73534"/>
<Node id="73535"/>REASON FOR CHOICE OF TEST SYSTEM<Node id="73567"/> <Node id="73568"/>The rat is a standard rodent species for use in oral gavage toxicity studies.<Node id="73645"/>
<Node id="73646"/>REASON FOR CHOICE OF ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION<Node id="73690"/> <Node id="73691"/>The oral route has been selected since this is the intended route of administration in humans.<Node id="73785"/>
<Node id="73786"/>REASON FOR DOSE LEVEL SELECTION<Node id="73817"/> <Node id="73818"/>The doses were selected based on the results of a previous exploratory 2-week oral toxicity study performed in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats at 50, 200 and 600 mg/kg/day (DDO 0979, sanofi-aventis). In the latter study, all rats dosed at 600 mg/kg/day were found dead or euthanized prematurely on Day 5 following body weight loss and other clinical signs of hypomotility, ataxia, dyspnea, polyuria, skin redness and/or ptyalism. The dose of 200 mg/kg/day led to the premature demise of 3/12 rats (2 males and 1 female) on Day 14 or 15 and was associated with body weight loss and late onset clinical signs. The dose of 50 mg/kg/day was clinically well tolerated over 2 weeks, with only slight reductions in body weight gain and no compound-related clinical signs. In order to attain the study objectives (mainly induction of renal toxicity) without compromising animal health status and survival, the dosing duration will be reduced from 15 to 10 days and the doses selected are 50 and 200 mg/kg/day. Main study: 5 rats/sex/group1 and 3 (interim termination), 10 rats/sex/group (terminal termination); toxicokinetic study: 9 rats/sex/treatment group and 3 rats/sex/control group, plus 5 rat/sex of spares from the same batch of animals ordered for the study.<Node id="75081"/>

<Node id="75351"/>Housing<Node id="75358"/> <Node id="75359"/>On arrival, animals will be group housed (up to 3 animals of the same sex and same dosing group together) in solid bottom cages, with bedding, equipped with an automatic watering valve unless deemed inappropriate by the Study Director and/or Clinical Veterinarian. The environmental enrichment program will be in accordance with the appropriate SOP. Each cage will be clearly labeled with a color-coded cage card indicating project, group, animal numbers and sex. Cages will be arranged on the racks in group order. Where possible, control group animals will be housed on a separate rack from the test article treated animals. Each animal will be uniquely identified using the AIMS ® tail tattoo system or other permanent marker. If required, animals may be temporarily identified using indelible ink. Maximum allowable concentrations of contaminants in the diet (e.g., heavy metals, aflatoxin, organophosphate, chlorinated hydrocarbons, PCBs) are controlled and routinely analyzed by the manufacturers. The results of the analysis are reviewed by the attending veterinary and retained at PCS-SHG.<Node id="76456"/> <Node id="76457"/>Municipal tap water which has been softened, purified by reverse osmosis and exposed to ultraviolet light will be freely available (except during designated procedures).<Node id="76626"/> <Node id="76627"/>Periodic analysis of the water is subcontracted to management authorized analytical laboratories which are audited by the Quality Assurance department of PCS-SHG.

<Node id="101175"/>INTRODUCTION<Node id="101187"/> <Node id="101188"/>The objective of this study was to investigate the potential toxicity of SAR377142 during daily oral gavage to the rats at doses of 50 and 200 mg/kg/day for a minimum of 3 or 10 days. In addition, the toxicokinetic characteristics of SAR377142 were determined.<Node id="101448"/>
<Node id="101449"/>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES<Node id="101472"/> <Node id="101473"/>The experimental design, applicable to pathological investigations, is summarized below in <Node id="101564"/>Text Table 1<Node id="101576"/> .<Node id="101578"/> <Node id="101579"/>Text <Node id="101584"/>Table 1<Node id="101591"/> Summary of Experimental Design A complete gross pathological examination was performed on all main study animals on Day 4 and Day 11 and organ weights were recorded, as specified in the protocol. Full histopathological examination was done on all animals from Groups 1 and 3 euthanized on Day 11. Partial histopathological examination, limited to the kidney was performed on all animals in Groups 1 and 3 euthanized on Day 4 and all animals in Group 2 euthanized on Day 11.<Node id="102065"/>

<Node id="102089"/>Mortality<Node id="102098"/> <Node id="102099"/>There were no preterminal deaths during the course of this study. <Node id="102165"/>(Table 8, Table 9<Node id="102182"/> , Appendix 19 and Appendix 20)<Node id="102213"/>
<Node id="102214"/>Organ Weights<Node id="102227"/>
<Node id="102228"/>Day 4<Node id="102233"/> <Node id="102234"/>No test article-related effects were noted on organ weights (absolute and relative to body weight) of male and female rats dosed with SAR377142 daily for 3 days.<Node id="102395"/>
<Node id="102396"/>Day 11<Node id="102402"/> <Node id="102403"/>No test article-related effects were noted on organ weights (absolute and relative to body weight) of male and female rats dosed with SAR377142 daily for 10 days.<Node id="102565"/> <Node id="102566"/>All organ weight differences noted on Day 4 and Day 11, including those that reached statistical significance, were considered to be within expected biological variation seen in rats of this age. <Node id="102762"/>(Table 10<Node id="102771"/> and Appendix 21)<Node id="102788"/>
<Node id="102789"/>Macroscopic Findings<Node id="102809"/>
<Node id="102810"/>Day 4<Node id="102815"/> <Node id="102816"/>No significant macroscopic changes were observed in male and female rats dosed daily with SAR377142 for 3 days.<Node id="102927"/>
<Node id="102928"/>Day 11<Node id="102934"/> <Node id="102935"/>Macroscopic finding considered to be related to the administration of SAR377142 was seen in the kidney of both male and female rats given SAR377142 daily for 10 days.<Node id="103101"/> <Node id="103102"/>Pale discoloration of the medulla or corticomedullary junction was observed in 1/10 male and 7/10 female rats at 200 mg/kg/day. This finding correlated microscopically with medullary tubular degeneration/regeneration.<Node id="103319"/> <Node id="103320"/>All other gross findings observed in various organs and tissues of rats euthanized on Day 4 and 11 were considered to be agonal or incidental in origin. Histopathological changes considered to be SAR377142-related were observed in the kidney.<Node id="103562"/> <Node id="103563"/>Minimal tubular degeneration/regeneration was observed in the outer medulla of 4/5 male and 1/5 female rats at 200 mg/kg/day.<Node id="103688"/>
<Node id="103689"/>Day 11<Node id="103695"/> <Node id="103696"/>Histopathological changes considered to be SAR377142-related were observed in the kidney.<Node id="103785"/> <Node id="103786"/>Minimal to marked tubular degeneration/regeneration was observed in the outer medulla of all male and female rats at 200 mg/kg/day.<Node id="103917"/> <Node id="103918"/>Tubular degeneration/regeneration was morphologically comparable in both study phases and located primarily in the inner stripe of the outer medulla, extending occasionally in the outer stripe of the outer medulla. The tubules were lined by enlarged basophilic, often vacuolated, epithelial cells showing enlarged irregular vesicular nuclei and bulging into the tubule lumen. These changes were associated with individual tubular cell necrosis, the presence of necrotic cellular debris in tubular lumen, low number of mitotic figures interpreted as early evidence of regeneration, tubular dilatation and mononuclear cell infiltration. An increase in incidence and severity of tubular degeneration/regeneration was noted with longer duration of treatment.<Node id="104672"/> <Node id="104673"/>All other microscopic findings seen in the kidney and various organs and tissues were considered to be agonal, incidental or related to the experimental procedure and were of no toxicological significance.  <Node id="104880"/>218  1004  158
