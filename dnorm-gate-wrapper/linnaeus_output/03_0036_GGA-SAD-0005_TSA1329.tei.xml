<Node id="1670"/>SUMMARY (Preliminary results)<Node id="1699"/> <Node id="1700"/>The oral administration of SAR377142E for 1 month to rats at doses of 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg/day resulted in compound-related mortality in 1/16 males at 100 mg/kg/day; no clinical signs and no ocular abnormalities at whatever the dose level; body weight gain decreases throughout the study primarily in males treated at 100 mg/kg/day, with decreases in food intake. At clinical pathology examination, the very few compound-related findings consisted of prolongations of Prothrombin times in both animals at 100 mg/kg/day, related to the pharmacological activity of the compound, and variations in urinalysis parameters from 30 mg/kg/day (increases in urine volumes and presence of proteins, reversible). Compoundrelated microscopic findings were noted from 30 mg/kg/day in the diaphragm in males (myofiber necrosis and regeneration) and at 100 mg/kg/day in the adrenal gland in females (increase in severity of the cell vacuolation in the zona glomerulosa), in the mesenteric lymph node in both sexes (increase in enlarged pigmented macrophages aggregates number), in the kidney in both sexes (tubular cell degeneration and regeneration, tubular cell anisokaryosis and karyomegaly, tubular dilatation and tubular cell mitoses) affecting most tubules (loop of Henle tubules and collecting ducts) in the inner stripe of the outer medulla in males and females with a higher severity in males, and scattered tubules (loop of Henle tubules, distal tubules and collecting ducts) in the outer stripe of the outer medulla and in the cortex in males. After a 4-week treatment free period, compound-related microscopic changes were still present in the kidney in males (occasional tubular cell anisokaryosis and mild tubular basophilia with peritubular fibrosis) and in the adrenal gland in females (increase in severity in cell vacuolation of the zona glomerulosa). At 100 mg/kg/day, samples from the kidney outer medulla were examined in electron miroscopy and compound-related ultrastructural changes were noted in the descending thin limb of the loop of Henle (cell regeneration) in the inner stripe of the outer medulla, the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (cell degeneration/necrosis, increase in lysosomes number containing laminated membrane structures) in the outer medulla (both inner and outer stripes), in the outer medullary collecting ducts (cell degeneration/necrosis), myelin figures) and in the inner medullary collecting ducts (myelin figures). Therefore, under these study conditions, the dose of 10 mg/kg/day was considered to be a NoObserved Effect Level (NOEL) and the dose of 30 mg/kg/day was considered to be a NoObserved Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) based on urinalysis variations and minimal microscopic findings in the diaphragm, with corresponding Cmax and AUC values in male/female rats of 1170/2140 ng/mL and 14600/18700 ng.h/mL, respectively<Node id="4570"/>

<Node id="14077"/>Rationale for dose selection<Node id="14105"/> <Node id="14106"/>Doses of 0 (controls), 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg/day given orally to rats were selected based on the results of a previous exploratory 14-day oral toxicity study in rats treated at doses of 50, 200 or 600 mg/kg/day (Report: DDO0979, in progress). In this study, oral administration of SAR377142E resulted in mortality at 200 mg/kg/day (1/6 males and 1/6 females found dead on Day 14 and 1/5 surviving male sacrificed preterminally on Day 15) and at 600 mg/kg/day (6 animals found dead and 6 sacrificed preterminally on Day 5); some clinical signs from 200 mg/kg/day with a higher incidence in males (slight hypomotility, slight palpebral ptosis, redness of the skin, ptyalism and signs of health deterioration); body weight loss (up to day 10 at 200 mg/kg/day) and moderate to severe food consumption reductions from 200 mg/kg/day. At clinical pathology examination performed at 50 and 200 mg/kg/day, major findings consisted of moderate increases in total neutrophils and urea level, and moderate prolongation of PT and APTT in animals treated at 200 mg/kg/day as compared to controls. Compound-related target organs from 200 mg/kg/day were the kidney (tubular degeneration / necrosis with regeneration in medulla and cortex, anisokaryosis, and tubular dilatation), spleen (increased number of neutrophils), adrenal gland (cortical cell vacuolation in the outer area of zona fasciculata) and lung / parabronchic lymph nodes (foamy histiocytes). At 50 mg/kg/day, only a slightly lower body weight gain compared to controls was noted in both sexes with a reduced food intake.<Node id="15675"/> <Node id="15676"/>Therefore, the dose of 10 mg/kg/day was selected as the low dose in the present study with the intent to get systemic exposure similar to that obtained at the pharmacologically active dose and to establish a no-effect level. The high dose, 100 mg/kg/day, was chosen to identify target organ toxicity. And the mid-dose (30 mg/kg/day) was chosen to establish a dose-relationship for any treatment-related effect.<Node id="16086"/>

Exposure to SAR377142 increased with dose in both male and female rats over the range 10 to 100 mg/kg on day 1 and day 28. The exposure was roughly dose proportional.<Node id="34833"/> <Node id="34834"/>No conclusion on the accumulation of SAR377142 was possible because the administered doses were different between day 1 and day 28.

Compound-related mortality occurred at 100 mg/kg/day in animal No. 4M65, found dead before dosing on Day 14. Most of the organs or tissues were autolyzed. The microscopic changes reported in liver (minimal mixed inflammatory cell infiltrates in few portal tracts) or kidney (minimal and multiple foci of tubular degeneration and regeneration in the inner stripe of the outer medulla) did not solely explain the death. Moreover, no clinical signs were noted from the first day of treatment. The cause of death of this animal was considered to be undetermined.<Node id="35905"/> <Node id="35906"/>At 30 mg/kg/day, the death of the male No. 3M46 on Day 24 occurred during blood sampling and was considered to be accidental. A red nasal discharge was noted at necropsy and the lung was colored in red. This last change was correlated microscopically with the presence of blood in lung in most of alveoli and few bronchioli. In addition, some blood was reported in the lumen of trachea and esophagus.<Node id="36306"/> <Node id="36307"/>At 30 mg/kg/day, the animal No. 3M39 was found dead after dosing on Day 25, with unspecific clinical signs of diffuse alopecia and wound on cheek with scab. At necropsy, a foamy content was noted in trachea, and the lung was not collapsed and was colored in red. The microscopic findings in the lung consisted of a moderate congestion, a mild intraalveolar edema and a mild and multifocal fibrillar material deposit in alveoli. The cause of the death was likely consistent with misdosing.<Node id="36795"/> <Node id="36796"/>No clinical signs were observed throughout the dosing and the recovery periods at whatever the dose.

<Node id="52810"/>CONCLUSION<Node id="52820"/> <Node id="52821"/>The oral administration of SAR377142E for 1 month to rats at doses of 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg/day resulted in compound-related mortality in 1/16 males at 100 mg/kg/day; no clinical signs and no ocular abnormalities at whatever the dose; body weight gain decreases throughout the study primarily in males treated at 100 mg/kg/day, with decreases in food intake. At clinical pathology examination, the very few compound-related findings consisted of prolongations of Prothrombin Times in both animals at 100 mg/kg/day, related to the pharmacological activity of the compound, and variations in urinalysis parameters from 30 mg/kg/day (increases in urine volumes and presence of proteins, reversible). Compound-related microscopic findings were noted from 30 mg/kg/day in the diaphragm in males (myofiber necrosis and regeneration) and at 100 mg/kg/day in the adrenal gland in females (increase in severity of the cell vacuolation in the zona glomerulosa), in the mesenteric lymph node in both sexes (increase in enlarged pigmented macrophages aggregates number), in the kidney in both sexes (tubular cell degeneration and regeneration, tubular cell anisokaryosis and karyomegaly, tubular dilatation and tubular cell mitoses) affecting most tubules (loop of Henle tubules and collecting ducts) in the inner stripe of the outer medulla in males and females with a higher severity in males, and scattered tubules (loop of Henle tubules, distal tubules and collecting ducts) in the outer stripe of the outer medulla and in the cortex in males. After a 4-week treatment free period, compound-related microscopic changes were still present in the kidney in males (occasional tubular cell anisokaryosis and mild tubular basophilia with peritubular fibrosis) and in the adrenal gland in females (increase in severity in cell vacuolation of the zona glomerulosa). At 100 mg/kg/day, samples from the kidney outer medulla were examined in electron miroscopy and compound-related ultrastructural changes were noted in the descending thin limb of the loop of Henle (cell regeneration) in the inner stripe of the outer medulla, the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (cell degeneration/necrosis, increase in lysosomes number containing laminated membrane structures) in the outer medulla (both inner and outer stripes), in the outer medullary collecting ducts (cell degeneration/necrosis), myelin figures) and in the inner medullary collecting ducts (myelin figures).<Node id="55276"/> <Node id="55277"/><![CDATA[Therefore, under these study conditions, the dose of 10 mg/kg/day was considered to be a NoObserved Effect Level (NOEL) and the dose of 30 mg/kg/day was considered to be a NoObserved Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) based on urinalysis variations and minimal microscopic findings in the diaphragm. +EN ATTENTE BIOMARQUEURS, with corresponding Cmax and AUC values in male/female rats of 1170/2140 ng/mL and 14600/18700 ng.h/mL, respectively. 45 min < S9 ≤ 1h Session 10 1h < S10 ≤ 1h30 Session 11 1h30 < S11 ≤ 2h Session 12 2h < S12 ≤ 2h30 Session 13 2h30 < S13 ≤ 3h Session 14 3h < S14 ≤ 3h30 Session 15 3h30 < S15 ≤ 4h Session 16 4h < S16 ≤ 4h30 Session 17 4h30 < S17 ≤ 5h Session 18 5h < S18 ≤ 5h30 Session 19 5h30 < S19 ≤ 6h Session 20 6h < S20 ≤ 6h30 Toxicology study report TSA1329 ]]><Node id="56060"/>Session 21 6h30 &lt; S21 ≤ 7h Session 22 7h &lt; S22 ≤ 7h30 Session 23 7h30 &lt; S23 ≤ 8h Session 24 8h &lt; S24 ≤ 9h<Node id="56165"/>

<Node id="80159"/>Chemicals and Reagents<Node id="80181"/> <Node id="80182"/>All materials, and reagents used in this study were as described, in the assay validation report <Node id="80279"/>[1]<Node id="80282"/> and in material and method given in Appendix 2. SAR377142E (Batch 0600019122) and [2H7]-SAR377142 (Batch SYC0491) were obtained from sanofi-aventis. The Certificate of Analysis for SAR377142E and the data sheet for [2H7]-SAR377142 can be found in Appendix 1.<Node id="80541"/>
<Node id="80542"/>Assay Procedure<Node id="80557"/> <Node id="80558"/>All specimens, calibration and QC samples with PMSF were analyzed within the documented stability period of 28 weeks at approximately -20°C using a validated physicochemical method for SAR377142E <Node id="80754"/>[1]<Node id="80757"/> . The lower limit of quantification for this assay (LLOQ) is 1 ng/mL. All analytical runs are shown in Appendix 3.<Node id="80872"/> <Node id="80873"/>Sample preparation procedure and analytical conditions are presented in Appendix 2.<Node id="80956"/>
<Node id="80957"/>Run acceptance criteria<Node id="80980"/> <Node id="80981"/>For a calibration curve to be considered acceptable, a minimum of 6 calibration levels and 75% of all calibration standards had to fall within ± 15% (± 20% at the LLOQ) of nominal and the calibration curve must have had at least one calibration standard at the ULOQ and the LLOQ of the calibration curve. No more than 33.3% of all QC samples could be considered unacceptable (i.e. missed injection, lost sample, low internal standard, outside ± 15% of nominal) and at least 50% of the QCs at a specific level (LOW QC, MID QC or HIGH QC) must have been acceptable. All QC sets (three QC samples comprising a LOW QC, MID QC and HIGH QC sample) must have had at least one acceptable QC sample.<Node id="81671"/>

<Node id="81793"/>RESULTS<Node id="81800"/> <Node id="81801"/>Data were acquired and integrated using Analyst (version 1.4.1, Applied Biosystems). Peak area results were exported into LIMS Sample Manager (version 3.2., LabSystems) in text file format. LIMS Sample Manager was used to calculate concentration data for SAR377142E. The concentration data, generated by computerized techniques and presented in this report, were verified as accurate to 3 decimal places.<Node id="82205"/>

<Node id="87959"/>Luminex Testing<Node id="87974"/> <Node id="87975"/>Using automated pipetting on Tecan Genesis robots, an aliquot of each sample was introduced into one of the capture microsphere multiplexes of the Human Antigen MAP. These mixtures of sample and capture microspheres were thoroughly mixed and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Multiplexed cocktails of biotinylated, reporter antibodies for each multiplex were then added robotically and after thorough mixing, were incubated for an additional hour at room temperature.<Node id="88450"/> <Node id="88451"/>Multiplexes were developed using an excess of streptavidin-phycoerythrin solution which was thoroughly mixed into each multiplex and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The volume of each multiplexed reaction was reduced by vacuum filtration and the volume increased by dilution into matrix buffer for analysis. Analysis was performed in a Luminex 100 instrument and the resulting data stream was interpreted using proprietary data analysis software developed at Rules-Based Medicine and licensed to Qiagen Instruments.<Node id="88976"/> <Node id="88977"/>Assays were run in high density multiplexed panels and Least Detectable Dose (LDD) was determined as the mean +3 standard deviations of 20 blank readings. Appropriate dilutions were made to ensure a quantitative measurement within the limits of the assay.<Node id="89232"/> <Node id="89233"/>An (8) parameter standard curve was used to obtain quantitative measurements for each sample. QC's were run along (3) points of the curve to ensure both accuracy and precision.<Node id="89409"/> <Node id="89410"/>.<Node id="89411"/>
<Node id="89412"/>Experimental Design<Node id="89431"/> <Node id="89432"/>Multiplexing is accomplished by assigning each analyte-specific assay a microsphere set labeled with a unique fluorescence signature ( <Node id="89567"/>Figure 3A<Node id="89576"/> ). To attain 100 distinct microsphere signatures, two fluorescent dyes, red and far red, are mixed in various combinations using ten intensity levels of each dye (i.e., 10 x 10). Each batch or set of microspheres is encoded with a fluorescent signature by impregnating the microspheres with one of these dye combinations ( <Node id="89900"/>Figure 3B<Node id="89909"/> ).<Node id="89912"/>
<Node id="89913"/>TSA1329<Node id="89920"/> <Node id="89921"/>Biomarker Analysis <Node id="89940"/>Figure 3<Node id="89948"/> . Schematic of one hundred unique microsphere sets. Each set contains a specific ratio of two fluorescent dyes on the interior of the microsphere, distinguishing the set from other sets in the array.<Node id="90148"/> <Node id="90149"/>After the encoding process, an assay-specific capture reagent (i.e., antigens, antibodies, receptors, peptides, enzyme substrates, etc.) is conjugated covalently to each unique set of microspheres <Node id="90346"/>(Figure 4<Node id="90355"/> ). Covalent attachment of the capture reagent to the microspheres is achieved with standard carbodiimide chemistry using carboxyl functional groups located on the surface of each 5.6 μm microsphere and primary amines within the capture reagent. Coupling chemistry is performed on large numbers of individual microspheres (10 7 -10 9 microspheres/mL) simultaneously within each unique set, resulting in low microsphere-to-microsphere variability.<Node id="90801"/> <Node id="90802"/>After optimizing the parameters of each assay separately, Multi-Analyte Profiles are performed by mixing up to 100 different sets of the microspheres in a single well of a 96-or 384-format microtiter plate. A small sample volume (10 μL -20 μL) is added to the well and allowed to react with the microspheres. The assay-specific capture reagent on each individual microsphere binds the analyte of interest. A cocktail of assay-specific, biotinylated detecting reagents (e.g., antigens, antibodies, ligands, etc.), is reacted with the microsphere mixture, followed by a streptavidin-labeled fluorescent "reporter" molecule (typically phycoerythrin). Because the microspheres are in suspension, the assay kinetics are near solution-phase. Finally, the multiplex is washed to remove unbound detecting reagents. After washing, the mixture of microspheres is analyzed using the Luminex 100™ instrument. Similar to a flow cytometer, the instrument uses hydrodynamic focusing to pass the microspheres in single file through two laser beams ( <Node id="91836"/>Figure 5A<Node id="91845"/> ).<Node id="91848"/> <Node id="91849"/>As each individual microsphere passes through the excitation beams, it is analyzed for size, encoded fluorescence signature and the amount of fluorescence generated in proportion to the analyte. Microsphere size, determined by measuring the 90-degree light scatter as the microspheres pass through a red diode laser (633 nm), is used to eliminate microsphere aggregates from the analysis. While in the red excitation beam, the encoded red and far red dyes are excited and the resulting fluorescence signature (ratio 660 nm / 720 nm) is filtered, measured using avalanche photodiodes, and classified to a microsphere set. Since each microsphere is encoded with a unique signature, the classification identifies the analyte being measured on that individual microsphere ( <Node id="92619"/>Figure  5C<Node id="92629"/> ). As the microsphere passes through a green diode-pumped solid state laser (532 nm), a fluorescence "reporter" signal (580 nm) is generated in proportion to the analyte concentration, filtered and measured using a photomultiplier tube ( <Node id="92868"/>Figure 5B<Node id="92877"/> ). <Node id="92881"/>
<Node id="92882"/>Methods of Evaluation and Statistics<Node id="92918"/> <Node id="92919"/>Data acquisition, analysis and reporting were performed in real-time on all microsphere sets included in the MAP. A minimum of fifty individual microspheres from each unique set were analyzed and the median value of the analyte-specific, or "reporter," fluorescence is logged. Using calibrators and assay controls, specific, sensitive, and quantitative results are achieved with precision enhanced by the analysis of fifty microspheres per data point.<Node id="93370"/> <Node id="93371"/>For each multiplex, both calibrators and controls were included on each microtiter plate. 8-point calibrators were run in the first and last column of each plate and 3-level controls were included in duplicate. Testing results were determined first for the high, medium and low controls for each multiplex to ensure proper assay performance.<Node id="93712"/> <Node id="93713"/>Assays were not accepted if QC did not pass acceptance criteria. Results are only reported from assays passing acceptance criteria.

No. 875406), Colorimetric assay, Modular P Roche Diagnostics, France N-Acetyl-β-D- Glucosaminidase, mU / ColTime, NAG Rat Stabilizing Buffer Biotrin International SARL, France6 STATISTICAL METHODSThe statistical evaluation were based on the assumption of a monotonic dose response relationship. A step down trend test procedure was applied, using all doses to determine the dose level at which there was no statistical significance of trend for each parameter. The NAG activity values were analyzed either by Turkey step-down trend test, if normally distributed, or by the Jonckheere trend test with corrections for ties, if not normally distributed, associated with a step-down procedure.7 DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS SYSTEMSData were recorded using Provantis NT2.2 software. The statistics were generated using AvenTox 3.2 software and the phase report was generated using GRESDA version 2 software.Toxicology Study Report sanofi-aventis group Page 9 of 21 TSA1329 Clinical Pathology strictly confidential Toxicology study report TSA1329 Sanofi-Aventis property -strictly confidential Page 893 8 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The NAG activity data are reported in the tables entitled [ Individual Urine Chemistry values] and [Summary of Urine Chemistry values]<Node id="1043307"/> <Node id="1043308"/>Toxicology Study Report

MAPs offer additional advantages in that they are developed fully, validated and available for immediate use. Once the biomarker patterns for a specific aim are discovered and validated, the biomarkers themselves can be adapted to many other detection platforms. Currently, RBM's MAPs measure markers of cancer, infectious disease, autoimmunity, cardiovascular risk, as well as hormones, cytokines/chemokines, acute phase reactants, clotting proteins, growth factors, tissue modeling factors and other typical plasma proteins. This massive screening approach is employed by pharmaceutical and medical research communities to identify combinations, levels, or absences of proteins associated with various disease states or drug treatments.Our scientists have been successful in this approach by developing our two primary commercial products: the Rodent MAP™ and the Human MAP™. The Rodent MAP™ is a test panel which allows RBM to simultaneously analyze ~90 analytes in a single drop of mouse or rat plasma. Similarly, the Human MAP™ measures over 200 analytes in human plasma or serum.<Node id="1059960"/> <Node id="1059961"/>4

Procedure and data were examined for completion and consistency with SOPs. The customer report was audited to ensure that it accurately represented the raw data produced during this phase of the study.It is noted that RBM sent notification of receipt of 1 sample not listed on the manifest received with the shipment. Confirmation from Sanofi-Aventis was received to test that sample. Receipt, testing, and reporting occurred as per normal workflow and procedures. There were no phase audit findings for this work.As far as can reasonably be established, the methods described and results accurately reflect the raw data produced during this study.Margaret Sandefur, Ph.D.Director of Quality Assurance6 ComplianceAll aspects of the analysis for Sanofi-Aventis Study TSA1329 were performed in adherence to all applicable parts of FDA 21CFR Part 58

<Node id="1122331"/>Introduction<Node id="1122343"/>
<Node id="1122344"/>Multi-Analyte Profile (MAP) Technology<Node id="1122382"/> <Node id="1122383"/>RBM was formed to develop and market proprietary protein-based products and services across the life sciences spectrum. By leveraging experience and expertise with the powerful Luminex xMAP ® technology platform, RBM has developed species-specific MultiAnalyte Profiles (MAPs) ( <Node id="1122662"/>Figure 1<Node id="1122670"/> ) that measure hundreds of biochemical markers in a very small sample volume. Any stimulus endured by an individual or animal model can result in alterations of biochemical pathways, yet few of these changes are wellcharacterized. Using MAPs to measure a broad spectrum of biomarkers, a more comprehensive analysis of a physiological status can be obtained. Luminex technology performs up to 100 multiplexed, microsphere-based assays in a single reaction vessel by combining optical classification schemes, biochemical assays, flow cytometry and advanced digital signal processing hardware and software ( <Node id="1123276"/>Figure 2<Node id="1123284"/> ).<Node id="1123287"/>

<Node id="1123701"/>Sample Receipt and Storage<Node id="1123727"/> <Node id="1123728"/>Samples were received and inspected against shipping documentation. Each sample shipment was assigned a unique RBM Order number and the sample state upon receipt and correlation to shipping documentation was assessed and customer notified of receipt and status. Samples were stored frozen -70 ±10° C in designated freezer locations. If any discrepancies were noted, samples were placed on hold designation until resolution was obtained. Once all discrepancies (if any) with samples in each order were resolved samples were released for testing.<Node id="1124272"/>
<Node id="1124273"/>Sample Processing<Node id="1124290"/> <Node id="1124291"/>Samples were processed and analyzed according to RBM procedural SOPs, for plasma antigen levels of the following 12 parameters: All samples were stored at -80°C until tested. The samples were thawed at room temperature, vortexed, spun at 13,000 x g for 5 minutes for clarification and 150 uL was removed for MAP antigen analysis into a master microtiter plate.  <Node id="1124653"/>6,<Node id="1124655"/> <Node id="1124656"/>2007<Node id="1124660"/> . Procedure and data were examined for completion and consistency with SOPs.
