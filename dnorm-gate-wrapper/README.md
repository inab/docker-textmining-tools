Dnorm: Disease name normalization with pairwise learning to rank.

DNorm is an automated method for determining which diseases are mentioned in biomedical text, the task of disease normalization. 

The machine learning approach for DNorm uses the NCBI disease corpus and the MEDIC vocabulary, which combines MeSH and OMIM.
Disease mentions are then located using the BANNER named entity recognizer. BANNER is a trainable system, using conditional random fields and a rich feature set approach.
DNorm algorithm achieves 0.782 micro-averaged F-measure and 0.809 macro-averaged F-measure.
